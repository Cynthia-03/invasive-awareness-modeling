Logistic regression and visualization of public recognition of invasive species in Shanghai using survey data.
# ðŸŒ± Invasive Species Recognition Analysis in Shanghai

This project analyzes public recognition of invasive species in Shanghai using survey data. It applies logistic regression modeling and data visualization to explore how demographic and psychological factors (e.g., nature relatedness) relate to whether people can identify invasive species.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- Converts detailed choice responses into binary recognition scores
- Calculates total recognition counts per respondent
- Builds and compares multiple logistic regression models
- Computes AIC, log-likelihood, number of parameters, Akaike weights (Wi)
- Visualizes predicted probabilities and nature relatedness effects
